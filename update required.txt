How to go about it:Requirements Phase:
In this phase, you gather and analyze the requirements for your software. This involves understanding what functionalities and features your application needs to have. Your documentation should include:

A detailed list of requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements.
Any stakeholder interviews or surveys conducted to gather requirements.
Analysis of the requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and feasible.
Design Phase:
Once the requirements are gathered, you design the software solution to meet those requirements. This involves creating architecture diagrams, wireframes, and mockups. Your documentation should include:

Architectural design diagrams showing how different components of the application will interact.
User interface wireframes or mockups to visualize the user experience.
Design decisions and justifications, explaining why certain design choices were made.
Implementation and Test Phase:
In this phase, you actually code, integrate, and test the software. Your documentation should include:

Code documentation, including comments and documentation strings explaining the purpose of each function and module.
Test plans outlining how each requirement will be tested to ensure it meets its intended functionality.
Test results showing the outcome of each test, including any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
Review Phase:
The review phase involves evaluating the software, reviewing the requirements, and proposing changes or additions. Your documentation should include:

An evaluation of the software against the requirements to determine if they have been met.
Any proposed changes or additions to the requirements based on the review.
A decision on whether to keep the software produced in this phase as a starting point for the next iteration or discard it.
Version Control:
Throughout the iterative development process, it's important to use version control effectively. Your documentation should include:

A record of changes made throughout the development stage, including commit messages and version history.
The rationale behind notable changes made, explaining why certain changes were implemented.
A clear versioning strategy, ensuring that different versions of the software are properly managed and documented.
By documenting each phase of the iterative development process in this way, you'll demonstrate a rigorous approach to software development and ensure that your Riget Zoo application meets its requirements effectively.
